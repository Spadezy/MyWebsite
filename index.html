                    <h3> About me!</h3>
                        <p1> My name is Rumman Ahmed, and I am a third year at OCAD University and studying Graphic Design. I started doing Graphic Design around 7 years ago, however I have always been into art since I was young. I feel like I have a creative mind which can help me in achieving my really ambitious goals.
                            I like to play video games, specifically VALORANT, however I have played way too many games growing up. There is much more about me, and if youâ€™d like to know, contact me!
